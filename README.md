**YETI CHALLENGE - JAMIESON REINHARD**

Hello Yeti Developers! Thanks for giving me the opportunity to work on this take-home assessment. I found it to be a lot of fun.

I think everything went really well for me with this challenge. It took a little bit time to figure out the tools at my disposal within Zepelin, but found it to be mostly intuitive given my Figma experience. Hopefully it's ok that I decided to use TailwindCSS in the project. I'm perfectly comfortable writing plain CSS and SCSS as well, but have been enjoying using Tailwind on most of my projects lately, so decided to make use of it here.

The one thing I would do differently if I could take the challenge again is to make commits as I completed each step of the challenge. I got very engaged in writing the code and by the time I remembered to make a commit, had already completed a significant portion of the work.

I'm looking forward to your feedback and to the next stages of the interview process. Thanks for taking the time to review!

Cheers, Jamieson
